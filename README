My Discontinued Projects from early high school.

#CODE DOES NOT REFLECT CURRENT CODING STYLES

###WARNING

[x]Magic numbers in a lot of early work
[x]Shitty Coding that a lot of loops could fix
[x]Extremely Undocumented
[x]Some completely pointless projects
[x]Some completely niche projects


That being said, feel free to ~~steal~~ borrow whatever code you need!
