Version 0.30.0.0 (2010-03-22)

Changed: Replaced the administrator unlock with a different anti-abuse feature: the ability to unlock KidSafe by solving a moderately-complex math problem (thanks to John T. Haller for RFE)
NOTE: this is a not a change we take lightly; however, to prevent abuse and its consequences (e.g. having PortableApps and/or KidSafe banned from public computers), as well as problems resulting from children having access to administrator accounts, a different anti-abuse feature was deemed necessary. We have spent a great deal of time discussing and implementing this to cause the least inconvenience possible while still maintaining the highest security possible; we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause users.


Version 0.27.0.0 (2010-02-26)

Improvement: Added built-in update checker (note that, if a new version of KidSafe is found and you choose to download it, the download page will open in your default browser - if you're using the PAF build and wish to use your portable browser, you should manually download updates instead. Using the built-in update checker is fine, you should just download the updates manually if you want to have total portability)

Version 0.25.6.0 (2010-02-19)
