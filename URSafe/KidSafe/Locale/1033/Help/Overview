KidSafe is a computer-locking application designed to keep young children from messing something up.

KidSafe will launch a full-screen window that hides the entire desktop, TaskBar, etc. Because the window is blank (except for the unlock entry box; see below for details), clicking it won't have any effect. Small children, who generally enjoy clicking the mouse, can click all they like without damaging anything.
If the appropriate option is set, KidSafe also prevent the system from being shutdown - even if a small child presses the power button, the system won't shut down.

If the appropriate options are set, KidSafe can disable all of the system keys - the Windows key, a combination of the Windows key and any other key, Alt-Tab, Alt-Escape, Ctrl-Escape, and Ctrl-Alt-Delete. This can be very useful, especially if a small kid keeps accidentally opening the Start Menu and selecting items in it: just disable the Windows key and the Ctrl-Escape key combination, and voila! No more Start Menu.
